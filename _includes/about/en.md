Hi I am Chris, a self-taught trader. This is my blog where I share my understanding of tradingand some sweet programs that automate daily routines, for example sentiment analysis, trade signal, trade execution, stock selection, etc. 

I love routines in exercise but hate anything else repetitive. 

I believe we achieve our greatest fulfilment by the act of creating and sympathezing with others. Tasks which are manual, repeititve and disrepsectful of humanity is a sign of primitiveness. I would like to make this world free of jobs that come under this category.
