Hi I am Chris, a self-taught trader. This is my blog where I share my life and a little bit of codes. I make small and sweet programs that automate daily routines, for example news sentiment analysis, automated trade execution, machine learning testing and image captioning. 

I love routines in exercise but hate anything else that is repetitive. 

I believe we achieve our greatest fulfilment by the act of creating and sympathezing with others. Tasks which are manual, repeititve and disrepsectful of humanity is a sign of primitiveness. I would like to make this world free of jobs that come under this category.

I study Internatinal Business in The Chinese University of Hong Kong, would be graduated in December this year.
